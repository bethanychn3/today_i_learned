The format of the file will always start and end with html
head is for the title tab
title is for the actual lettering in the title tab
body is for inside the web
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Today I Learned!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

Section 7: Working with Text & Lists
<ul> stands for unordered list and creating a list in html
<li> stands for list item -- put list items in 

Section 8: Hyperlinks, Images, Attributes
<a> means anchor
<a href="link name"> is how to paste and show a hyperlink

href and target are attributes of the target
target="" causes the user to move to the url but stay on the same page
target="_blank" causes the html to open a new tab

image element
- needs attributes
- no closing type
format: <img src="folder/logo.png"/>
src is the path to the img in the file
alt text is a textual description of whatever is in the image
so the img can be read by screen readers
format: alt="Some description"

Section 9: Structuring the APP
<header></header> "boxes in" the elements and groups them together
<main></main> same thing as above
**BE CAREFUL WHERE TO PLACE THE OPENING AND CLOSING STATEMENTS**
<button>text</button> will create a button left shifted

<aside></aside> to move things to the "side"
<section></section> section off a portion

Section 10: Building a Form
<form></form> to create a form
<input type="text"/> self-closing element
<select></select> for a select element
<option></option> should always have a value
format: <option value="technology">Tech</option>

Section 11: Adding Buttons
<strong>bold</strong> will make the text bold

Section 35: Values, Variables, and Operators
let votesInteresting = 23;
let votesMindblowing = 5;
const text = "sdfkjsdkfjd";

votesInteresting = votesInteresting + 1;

let votesFalse = 4;
const isCorrect = votesFalse < totalUpvotes;

Section 36: Functions
parseInt("24.533ccc");

function calcFactAge(year){
    const currentYear = 2022;
   
    // to get actual current year always accurate
    const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
    
    const age = currentYear - year;
    return age;
}

const age1 = calcFactAge(2015)

Section 37: If Else STATEMENTS
if(votesInteresting === votesMindblowing)
{
    alert("this fact is equally interesting and mindblowing");
}
else if (votesInteresting > votesMindblowing) {
    console.log("Interesting Fact");
}
else {
    console.log("something else");
}

falsy values: O, "", null, undefined
truthy value: everything else

Section 38: ternary Operators
let votesFalse = 7;
const totalupvotes = votesInteresting+ votesMindblowing

const message = totalUpvotes > votesFalse ? "The fact is true" : "the fact might be false"

Section 39: working with strings
const text = "libson..."
const upperText = text.toUpperCase();
console.log(upperText);

back ticks allow you to be able to print out variables into strings
const str = `the current fact is ${text} it is ${calcFactAge(2015)}
 years old. it is probably ${totalUpvotes > votesFalse ? "correct" : "not true"}`;
